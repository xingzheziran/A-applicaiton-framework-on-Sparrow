Application submission on Sparrow.
(1)
Files (including bash scripts, config_file) in directory slave shoud be copied to the same directory as sparrow-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ( the compiled Sparrow), e.g. ~/sparrow.

Files in master directory are deployed in the same way.

Files in apps subdirectory of master and slave are the configuration files of simulated applications.
E.g. app-0 in apps is used to initialize the corresponding backend and frontend of application 0 at slave side and master side respectively.
